The Three Types of Pilgrim

by Kathok Situ Chökyi Gyatso

Without desire, attachment, or any particular agenda or itinerary,With no selfish concerns,
simply roaming freely from place to placeFor the sake of others, benefitting impartially those
to be trained—This is the way of the very best type of pilgrim.

Following holy masters who are non-sectarian and free from faults,Receiving their Dharma teachings
without sectarian bias or conflict,And gathering virtue in sacred places without partiality
or attachment—This too is the way of the superior pilgrim.

Through devotion for the representations of enlightened body, speech and mind,Tirelessly amassing
merit in every monastery, hermitage and sacred site,With pure perception and without
ever quarrelling or losing heart—This is the approach of the middling type of pilgrim.

First making grand promises and plans to travel the globe,Then passing by sacred sites that
are reached by uphill roads,In the end, being content with having ‘been there’ and ‘done that’—This
is one aspect of the meaningless type of pilgrimage.

Never seeing the virtues of the saṅgha, but noticing their each and every fault,Never coming
close to sacred images and texts, but viewing them from afar,Requesting souvenirs when others
are around and stealing them when they are not—This is the second way in which a pilgrimage
becomes nothing but an evil outing.

Developing wrong views towards a sacred place when feeling tired,Or visiting a temple one day
and forgetting all about it the next,Getting angry along the way and considering it a sign
of courage—Avoid all such ‘pilgrimages’, which are merely futile forms of exertion.

In India, the sacred land of the Āryas,Many masters still remain, hidden and apparent,And so,
filled with faith and devotion,I prostrate and make prayers and aspirations.
